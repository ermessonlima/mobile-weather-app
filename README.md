# Mobile Weather App - Nees

The application developed as part of the mobile developer selection process is a weather forecast solution developed in React-Native. It uses data from a weather forecast API to display accurate and up-to-date information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant information for the user's current location. The aim is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience, with a clear and organized display of the weather information.



## Demonstration

Below, you can find videos demonstrating the use of the app in different scenarios, including during the day and at night, in both rainy and non-rainy conditions, on both iOS and Android versions. The videos provide a clear demonstration of the app's functionality in various scenarios. Check them out!
